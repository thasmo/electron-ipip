`ipip` runs in the Windows tray and on click it copies the public IP address into the clipboard.
Hovering over the tray icon with the cursor, will also show the current public IP address, which
gets updated every minute. Under the hood `ipip` uses `public-ip` which looks up the client's
public IP address via `opendns` DNS servers.

So far only tested on Windows 10.
